<br> <h1>KRISHNA ON HALF MOON</h1>
<br>
  <p>
   In frame is another mandala art design which is basically depicting lord Krishna playing his flute on a half moon.<br> Here there is a little bit of temple effect given to the moon. <br>The background of the drawing has a wash of yellow and pink watercolour. <br>the wash is basically been given to get the temple type atmosphere effect more for the picture .<br>

   Lord Krishna was now born as a Kshatriya (or warrior caste) of the Yadava clan and his second name, Vasudeva, was explained away as a patronym .<br>

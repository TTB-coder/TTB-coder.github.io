      <h1>BOTTLE PAINTING</h1>
<br>

  <p>
  	<br>
  	In frame is a beautiful bottle painting.<br> I have tried to keep it a bit simple and give a bit classy look.<br>Bottle painting is the best way to use a waste material.<br>I have basically used a sauce bottle as a pot by simply painting it and keeping a plant in it.<br>I feel its a best DIY craft that anyone can make<br> easily by painting or decorating thia so well.<br>I have used only two colours.<br> One can make it very colourful by using different colours.<br>
  	One can put lights and keep instead of plant if one wants.<br>

      <h1>CLEAR REFLECTION LANDSCAPE</h1>
<br>

  <p>
  	<br>
  	In frame is a simple lanscape painting of nature. it is a very normal painting with not much of things happening in background. <br>the main aim of this painting was to <br>show the reflection of the things on surface clearly reflecting in water and to give a realistic look to the reflection part.<br>
    The reflection of the sky in water is giving a very real effect in the painting with the reflection of trees.<br>

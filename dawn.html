      <h1>DAWN</h1>
<br>

  <p>
  	<br>
  	In frame is a simple lanscape painting of nature showing the time of dawn.<br> Dawn (on Earth) is the time that marks the beginning of twilight before sunrise.<br> This morning twilight period will last until sunrise (when the Sun's upper limb breaks the horizon),<br> when direct sunlight outshines the diffused light.<br>The main message that this picture wants to give is one should <br>always leave behind all the bad memories of each day behind<br> and start with a fresh mind which will help the day to pass with positive energy and not negative energy.<br>

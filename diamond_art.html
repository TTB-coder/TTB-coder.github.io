      <br> <h1>DIAMOND ART</h1>
<br>

  <p>

The main motive of doing the art in a different shape rather than a circle to give it a little unique look.<br> one can simply make this design on a canvas or might also use this design on different things.<br>

    <h3>steps one can follow(if needed) :</h3>
    <br>

    <li>Fist of all take a plain canvas and tape it from all sides using any tape so that<br> the margins dont get the colour or if you want the entire canvas black you can directly start painting.</li><br>
    <li>Take a wide paint brush and paint it all <br>black  and leave that it it dries well.</li><br>
    <li>After the canvas has dried up, draw the outline of diamond shape and<br> divide that shape into 4 mini diamonds using scale and pencil.</li><br>
    <li>Then you can start making any patterns or designs you would like to make inside<br> those mini diamonds shapes and after all the shapes are filled, it will be done.</li>

      <br> <h1>ILLUSIONAL MANDALA</h1>
<br>

  <p>

    In frame is one of the unique type of mandala art that is the illusional or 3D mandala art.<br> The illusional mandala art follows the same designing pattern as normal mandala designs witha little bit of change in dimesions and drawing structure. <br>The inner circles are to be drawn in such a way that<br> they all come and end on a single line and the outer circles are to be draw normal.<br> This is the main thing that would give a illusional effect to the drawing.

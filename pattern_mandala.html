      <h1>PATTERN MANDALA</h1>
<br>

  <p>
  	<br>
     The pattern dot mandala is a painting that has been done using two forms of colours.<br> This is made using warm and cool colours.<br> and the main motive behind this painting is to depict the good and bad part of life.<br> How both the things have a contrast in everyone’s life.<br>And it is also giving out a message like no life is perfect,<br> there is good times as well as bad times.<br>

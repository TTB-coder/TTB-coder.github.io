      <h1>PEACOCK MANDALA</h1>
<br>

  <p>
  	<br>
  	In frame is a beautiful peacock mandala dot art on a white canvas.<br> I have tried to show how elegant a peacock looks.<br> This bird is known as national bird of India.<br>
    The feathers of the peacock are following the same pattern of colours.<br> They are so colourful and has so many colours which enhances the look of the peacock.<br> They have a unique quality, they dance when in rains by opening their feathers and that site of them dancing is very fascinating to watch.<br>
